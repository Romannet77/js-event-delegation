Binding Event Listeners to Dynamically Created Elements in JavaScript

This small project was created on my initiative during my study "The Complete Web Developer in 2023: Zero to Mastery" Udemy course.

During learning DOM Events there was an exercise where I had to use "Binding Event Listeners to Dynamically Created Elements" to complete it successfully!

The code was very short but the road to it wasn't!

So, I decided to create the project using my JavaScript skills and experience with the explanation of the process.

I hope that it can help other people to understand better the "Event Delegation" Pattern in JavaScript and find an answer to the solution of the similar tasks!
